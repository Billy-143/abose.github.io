This is my home page! My name is Abinav Bose and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120
* Lab 2
    Lab 2 was my favorite one because I learned how to write the program and how to format it. I even learned how to clone a git repository from Github and make changes to it. I also learned how to edit it using text editor.
* Lab 4
    Lab 4 was my second favorite one because I learned how to write the code by using variables, initialization, arthimetic operators, input, output, if statements and relational operators. I learned about a testing called black box to make sure that my code is bug-free. I also learned how to use the make command statements to build and test my project.
* Lab 8
  Lab 8 was my third favorite because I learned how to write a loop through all the command-line arguments by skipping over the command name. I also learned how to validate a command-line argumentinput. This was mostly similar to all the previous labs.
